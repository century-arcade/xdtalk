## A little while ago on a computer not too far away....

???

- The year was 2016
- a software engineer was playing with some crossword data
- and discovered hundreds of crosswords that were near-duplicates
- of previously published crosswords.
- He showed the evidence to the crossword construction list he was on

# Everyone loves a scandal

<br/>
<br/>

## How did this happen to be discovered?


???

- these crosswords had been publicly available
- including historical ones
- since the crosswords were 're'published
- why did this go undiscovered for so long?

<blockquote>“when you get the data into a <b>nice</b>, <b>clean</b>, <b>dense</b> form, stuff just falls out of it”
</blockquote>
### &mdash; me
???
- the 538 article hints at it w/ something I said
- "when you get data into a nice, clean, dense form, stuff just falls out of it"
-  I said this off-the-cuff, but it's an accurate statement of the thesis I was testing at the time
- the format and organization were instrumental, maybe essential, to the discovery and decisive outcome

.footnote[xd.saul.pw]
???
- so this is how a file format
- led to a crossword scandal

class: middle, center

.image-100[![motivation](images/motivation.jpg)]

???
It all started when
- I tried my hand at crossword construction
- frustrating and tedious
- wanted to get better
- software engineer
- what else would you expect
- thought I would just get some data
- and do some "analysis"

---

class: center
# xwordinfo.com

.image-100[![xwordinfo](images/xwordinfo.png)]

???

- there is a site, xwordinfo
- which makes ALL of the NYTimes puzzles available
- I emailed and asked to download their data in bulk
---

class: center
# xwordinfo.com

# "no"
???
- Jeff Chen sent me a very polite "no"

---
class: center
# xwordinfo.com

- I can "just" scrape it

- 25,000 puzzles back to 1942

- Thanks to 3 years of work by David Steinberg and PSPP
???
- I could just scrape it
- but scraping is a pain
- They have 25k puzzles (back to 1942)
- BTW, a major shoutout to David Steinberg, who was in high school when he organized a group of hundreds of crossword enthusiasts over 3 years
- and they transcribed "litzed" all puzzles from 1942-1993 (when Will Shortz started the "digital age of crosswords"
- so collection of crossword data is non-trivial, and even having the major work already done, it was still going to be a pain for me

- and if something is a pain for me, rather than cut corners and do the minimum, I double down

---
class: center
# Once and For All

- archival format for analysis

- gift to future scholars
???
- I decided that I wanted to archive this data for posterity
- the data is currently scattered on many sites
  - the xwordinfo only has NYTimes crosswords.
  - there are many other publications that have their own crosswords
- and, the data is in many different formats, some of which are difficult to parse
- or the parsing can't even be automated, because of encoding errors upon encoding errors
- a gift for future crossword scholars

??
- so i realized i had to collect the data myself
- but i can't do things just for myself (don't really like myself enough to do it just for me)
- so i motivate myself to do it for someone in the future who may appreciate it
- this data is already public, and for good reason.  now it needs to be in a data-ready form!

# Plan

1. High Potential Format

2. ???

3. Profit
???
- I had a thesis which I mentioned in the opening
- get the data into a "High Potential Format"
- and then I don't know what
- and then profit!
---
class: center
# High Potential Format

- neat

- clean

- dense
???
- or HPF as I like to call it
- neat
  - tidy, organized
  - a place for everything and everything in its place
  - remember, it's not hoarding if it's organized
- clean
  - properly decoded
  - structurally correct
  - ready for grouping, sorting
  - trustworthy as a source
- dense
  - exhibits high data locality
  - on any axis that data can be sliced, it's reasonably easy to slice it that way

---
class: center
# Existing Standards

- **puz**: binary, proprietary

- **txt**: text with &lt; TAGS &gt;

- **xpf**: XML

- **ipuz**: JSON

???
- like a good engineer
- i looked at existing formats
- the granddaddy of crossword formats
   - acrosslite .puz
   - ubiquitous, de facto standard
   - binary, and proprietary
- acrosslite also has a very old .txt format
   - has HTML-like tags
   - fragile: clues aren't numbered, don't include answers
      - any extra line in the clues will render the puzzle undecipherable
- xpf is a little more modern, but is based on XML (yuck)
- ipuz is fairly new, and based on JSON
   - meh
- so like a bad engineer
---
# Custom Archival Format

- simple to parse

- mnemonic, reversible id

- hand-editable

- stable

???
- i decided to make my own format
- specifically for archival and analysis
- like the other formats, each crossword would be in its own file, with self-contained meta-data along-side the data
   - this is good data locality
- would be very easy to parse
   - ideally self-evident structure
- mnemonic and reversible id for shelving
- robust to hand-editing
   - since some parsing issues can't be resolved automatically
- finally, it would ideally be 'stable'
   - if multiple people 'litzed' the same crossword from the same source,
   - they would get identical .xd files with an identical id
   - the results should be byte-for-byte identical.

- this is the .xd format I designed
- first, notice the id: nyt, a 3-letter code for nytimes, and then the date, Y-M-D
   - id has some nice properties, like easy to sort, easy to split, easy to type
- actually looks pretty similar to the acrosslite txt format
- but there are some key differences that we'll get to

- crosswords basically have 3 sections

- made a janky pipeline to scrape, convert, and shelve crosswords
- I got the 24,000 puzzles from xwordinfo
- i found other public crossword sites and scraped them

- turned out that many lines had duplicates in other puzzles
- used another standard tool, diff, to compare the .xd files
- pulled on that thread, which kept me going
- led to another, and another
- that weekend is kind of a blur
- by the end I had found many interesting 'anomalies'

???
- for instance, this was the largest timespan difference
- originally published in the NYTimes in 1955 and credited to Jack Luzzato
- a nearly identical grid was published in the NYT in 1984, 29 years later, credited to Daniel Girardi
- only two letters in the grid changed
- but nearly every clue in the entire puzzle was rewritten

## 2 lines of Python

```python
hd = difflib.HtmlDiff()
hd.make_table(xd1, xd2)
```
???
- This diff output, btw, was made with just two lines of python code using difflib
- this was enabled by having the data in a presentable format in the first place
- it's not the prettiest, but it is completely functional
- accessible to everyone, including non-technical people

.image-100[![timburr](images/liz-gorski.png)]
???
- many of the puzzles had a common thread
   - edited by a "Timothy Parker"
   - I knew nothing about the crossword industry
   - I thought might be a fake name, a pseudonym for a syndicate of constructors
   - until I found his Wikipedia entry and his claim of a Guinness record for "most syndicated constructor"
   - I spent more than a few brain cycles trying to come up with reasons why his puzzles might be legitimately re-attributed

- this puzzle was the real clincher though
   - The puzzle on the right is from USA Today, 2013
   - by "Elizabeth Gorski", a prolific constructor
   - well-known and well-loved in the crossword community.
   - On the left, published by Universal uClick in 2006 (7 years earlier)
   - by a fellow named "Tim Burr"
   - what was going on?
   - why would a crossword syndicate publish an old crossword attributed to an obvious pseudonym,
   -  and change the attribution to someone who really existed?

- I wrote a grid comparator and ran it over all the puzzles
- I threw this list together to enumerate the "anomalies"
- comprehensive, but minimum effort
- sorted only by grid similarity
- linking to those scrappy diffs that we just saw

"I found some <b>pairs of crosswords that are strikingly similar</b>...

<blockquote>
    I wonder if <b>"Timothy Parker" might be a little loose with attribution</b>...

<blockquote>
<b>I present this as a curiosity</b>... Please also pardon the 'interface'.

???
- and I sent it to the crossword list
- I pulled out 3 examples, the 2 we saw and one other
- and said "I found some pairs of crosswords that are strikingly similar"
- I wondered if "Timothy Parker might be a little loose with attribution"
- and "I present this as a curiosity"
- was careful not to use the P-word

# People took a interest

???
- well, suffice to say, "people took a interest"
- "You may be onto something here"
- there was much discussion on the list and off
- this is where Ben Tausig got his information, and posted to twitter as we saw in the intro
- As the hubbub grew louder
- I asked someone from the crossword list for the collection I knew he must have
   - he publishes a huge clue/answer database once a quarter
- i doubt he would have given it to me before #gridgate blew up
- it's a shame that this data exists but is so difficult to obtain
- well he "asked his source for permission", and then did give it to me

???
- collected diligently over 20 years
- saved everything in source .puz!

- so the data was always "available"
- but it was not really public, because it was not accessible
- even barry's collection, which other people had access to
- not bulk-analysis friendly
- had not been organized

# (5 days after r/datasets)

- I spent the next week, before the 538 article was published
- ingesting 1000s more crosswords with my janky pipeline
- discovering what directories and filenames meant
- shelving properly in the xd corpus
- managing near-dups
- comparing grids exhaustively
- optimized to 1s/grid
- managing 50,000 of anything is challenging
- esp under time pressure

# 15 minutes of fame

???
- well, i do kind of regret that i
- didn't have something to sell
- not merchandise, stickers--though that might be something
- i mean my own career and story
   - NPR
-  wasn't comfy w/ attention
- hadn't groomed my online persona
- by the time it happens it's too late
- advice, be ready for the stampede
- have a website, with a coherent self-view, and some way for people to engage on your terms.
- even if it's just "sign up for my newsletter"

- improved and automated my janky pipeline
- came up with a workable visualization

# takeaways

- the scope of the plagiarism was egregious but finite
- completely overwhelmed the other instances, which I think are just as interesting
- actually hadn't done it much in 2015
  - "only" 9 puzzle self-plagiarisms, and 3 theme reworkings ("gutted puzzles") from newsweek

- in 2012, USAToday started running a puzzle on saturdays
  - it's reprint day.  fine.
  - why are they half red?
  - they're copies of *other* plagiarized puzzles.
  - not obvious before breakout by d-o-w

xd.saul.pw/specific puzzle

- finally looks decent
- can still see .xd structure underneath
- even `~` still in clues

- this puzzle was not reprinted once, but 4 separate times
- the final one (that I saw), was actually a legitimate reprint of the first instance
- it's the ones in the middle
- in 2005 reprinted under a false name with a corner changed
- again in 2006 a third of the puzzle changed, attributed to mr. tim burr
- and then the puzzle was gutted and the theme reused in 2009
- you can tell that the theme wasn't reproduced independently, because the black squares are also identical

### One more anomaly

.image-100[![comparison](images/univ2011-11.png)]
???
- okay, so he stole puzzles from himself and falsified attribution many times
- he's just a greedy hack, right?
- but that's not quite all of it...
- here's one more anomaly that I haven't yet figured out

- from USAToday Nov 2011
- all of these puzzles were originally by Marjorie Richter

### One more anomaly
.image-100[![comparison](images/usa2011-11.png)]
???
- and here, Universal uClick, Nov 2011
- 34 puzzles in a row
- originals all by Marjorie Richter
- not an accident
- he singled her out for som reason, but she never would have known
- this is the biggest mystery remaining for me

# Conclusion

???

- The simple .xd format was indeed instrumental in discovering this scandal.
- if i had gone looking for it, i could have found it with other formats
- but this made it so trivial to do some explorations, that it just 'fell out'


---
class: center
# Where are they now?

- Timothy Parker still editing
- xd still running
- lots more could be done
- I have new awesome projects

???

- In conclusion, where are we now?
- Mr. Parker is still editing crosswords at Universal
  - which is still syndicated in many newspapers, including the Seattle Times
- there is an ongoing need for a crossword watchdog
- xd is still running autonomously, but with minimal input and no audience
- so even if it caught more duplications, no one would actually know
- additionally, lots more could be done with this data
  - could have relevance for people interested in linguistics, history, culture
- but I have a job, and other projects like the awesome data exploration tool VisiData
