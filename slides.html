## A little while ago on a computer not too far away....

???

- The year was 2016
- a software engineer was playing with some crossword data
- and discovered hundreds of crosswords that were near-duplicates
- of previously published crosswords.
- He showed the evidence to the crossword construction list he was on

## A Plagiarism Scandal Is Unfolding In The Crossword World

<blockquote>
    Pwanson wasn’t searching for anything in particular when he began assembling his database, he said. He’s an aspiring constructor and wanted to explore how grids and words and phrases tended to come together to form a puzzle using the languages in which he’s fluent — programming and data. But <b>“when you get the data into a nice, clean, dense form, stuff just falls out of it,”</b> he said. And what fell out was surprising, and upsetting.
</blockquote>
???
- the 538 article hints at it w/ something I said
- "when you get data into a nice, clean, dense form, stuff just falls out of it"
-  I said this off-the-cuff, but it's an accurate statement of my data philosophy
- the format and organization were instrumental, maybe essential, to the discovery and decisive outcome

- so this is how a file format
- led to a crossword scandal

class: middle, center

.image-100[![motivation](images/motivation.jpg)]

???
It all started when
- I tried my hand at crossword construction
- frustrating and tedious
- wanted to get better
- software engineer
- what else would you expect
- thought I would just get some data
- and do some "analysis"

---

class: center
# xwordinfo.com

.image-100[![xwordinfo](images/xwordinfo.png)]

???

- there is a site, xwordinfo
- which makes ALL of the NYTimes puzzles available
- I emailed and asked to download their data in bulk
---

class: center
# xwordinfo.com

# "no"
???
- Jeff Chen sent me a very polite "no"

---
class: center
# xwordinfo.com

- I can "just" scrape it
- 25,000 puzzles back to 1942
- Thanks to 3 years of work by David Steinberg and PSPP
???
- I could just scrape it
- but scraping is a pain
- They have 25k puzzles (back to 1942)
- BTW, a major shoutout to David Steinberg, who was in high school when he organized a group of hundreds of crossword enthusiasts over 3 years
- and they transcribed "litzed" all puzzles from 1942-1993 (when Will Shortz started the "digital age of crosswords"
- so collection of crossword data is non-trivial, and even having the major work already done, it was still going to be a pain for me

- and if something is a pain for me, rather than cut corners and do the minimum, if I am going to do it, I am going to double down and do the maximum

# Once and For All

- archival and analysis format
- usable in 2100
- a gift to future crossword scholars
???
I decided that I wanted to archive this data
- copyright expires 95 years after publication
- so for crosswords published in 2005 (which makes them already pretty antiquated)
- they will be in the public domain in the year 2100.
- so I wanted to collect this data for posterity
- the data is currently scattered on many sites
  - the xwordinfo only has NYTimes crosswords.
  - there are many other publications that have their own crosswords
- and, the data is in many different formats, some of which are difficult to parse
- or the parsing can't even be automated, because of encoding errors upon encoding errors
- &amp;amp;amp;
- a gift for future crossword scholars

# Plan
<br>
<br>

1. High Potential Format

2. ???

3. Profit
???
- I had a thesis which I mentioned in the opening
- get the data into a "High Potential Format"
- and then I don't know what
- and then profit!

# High Potential Format (HPF)

- neat
- clean
- dense
???
- neat
  - well-organized
  - 
- clean
  - trustworthy
  - 
- dense
  - exhibits high data locality
  - on any axis that data can be sliced, it's reasonably easy to slice it that way

---
class: center
# existing formats

- .puz - binary
- .txt - SGML
- .xpf - XML
- .ipuz - JSON
???
- like a good engineer
- i looked at existing formats
- the granddaddy of crossword formats
   - acrosslite .puz
   - ubiquitous, de facto standard
   - binary, and proprietary
- acrosslite also has a very old .txt format
   - has HTML-like tags
   - fragile: clues aren't numbered, don't include answers
      - any extra line in the clues will render the puzzle undecipherable
- xpf is a little more modern, but is based on XML (yuck)
- ipuz is fairly new, and based on JSON
---
# Custom Archival Format

- simple to parse
- mnemonic, reversible id
- hand-editable
- stable

???
- then like bad engineer
- i decided to make my own format
- specifically for archival and analysis
- like the other formats, each crossword would be in its own file, with self-contained meta-data along-side the data
   - this is good data locality
- would be very easy to parse
   - ideally self-evident structure
- mnemonic and reversible id for shelving
- robust to hand-editing
   - since some parsing issues can't be resolved automatically
- finally, it would ideally be 'stable'
   - if multiple people 'litzed' the same crossword from the same source,
   - they would get identical .xd files with an identical id
   - the results should be byte-for-byte identical.

## r/datasets
<blockquote>
    I tried to get the raw crosswords for myself to play with, but they're a total pain to scrape and clean for analysis. I am actively practicing my data preparation skills, so I put a lot of work into making this a sweet little setup, and I'd like <b>to share it with people who can do better analysis than I can</b>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    In total, I found about 30,000 crosswords freely available online. (By my estimation, 30,000 is maybe 1-5% of all published crosswords.) Here they are, <b>organized and cleaned and reduced to their utter essence, in a carefully designed bulk text format</b>:
</blockquote>
???
- so i posted a link to the data to reddit in r/datasets
- "to share it with people who can do better analysis than I can"

.image-100[![nyt](images/nyt-diff.png)]

???
- so here's an interesting case from the NYTimes
- originally published in the NYTimes in 1955 and credited to Jack Luzzato
- a nearly identical grid was published in the NYT in 1984, 29 years later, credited to Daniel Girardi
- only two letters in the grid changed
- but nearly every clue in the entire puzzle was rewritten

.em2[```python
hd = difflib.HtmlDiff()
hd.make_table(xd1, xd2)

- This diff output, btw, was made with just two lines of python code using difflib

- it's not the prettiest, but it is completely functional
- accessible to everyone, including non-technical people

.image-100[![timburr](images/liz-gorski.png)]
???
- many of the puzzles had a common thread
   - edited by a "Timothy Parker"
   - I knew nothing about the crossword industry
   - I thought might be a fake name, a pseudonym for a syndicate of constructors
   - until I found his Wikipedia entry and his claim of a Guinness record for "most syndicated constructor"
   - I spent more than a few brain cycles trying to come up with reasons why his puzzles might be legitimately re-attributed

- this puzzle was the real clincher though
   - The puzzle on the right is from USA Today, 2013
   - by "Elizabeth Gorski", a prolific constructor
   - well-known and well-loved in the crossword community.
   - On the left, published by Universal uClick in 2006 (7 years earlier)
   - by a fellow named "Tim Burr"
   - what was going on?
   - why would a crossword syndicate publish an old crossword attributed to an obvious pseudonym,
   -  and change the attribution to someone who really existed?

# That next week was a blur

???
- I spent the next week, before the 538 article was published
- ingesting 1000s more crosswords with my janky pipeline
- discovering what directories and filenames meant
- shelving properly in the xd corpus
- managing near-dups
- comparing grids exhaustively
- optimized to 1s/grid
- managing 50,000 of anything is challenging
- esp under time pressure

# 15 minutes of fame
???
- stressful
- time consuming
- everyone loves a scandal
- people cared about the scandal, not the process, nor the facts
- story > facts
- I wasn't prepared

# 15 minutes of fame

### no ragrets

???
- didn't have something to sell
- not merchandise, stickers--though that might be something
- i mean my own career or 'celebrity' if you will
   - NPR
-  wasn't comfy w/ attention
- hadn't groomed my online persona
- by the time it happens it's too late
- advice, be reaedy for the stampede
- have a website, with a coherent self-view, and a way to capitalize on having 10s of thousands of people stop by.  even if it's only "sign up for my newsletter"
